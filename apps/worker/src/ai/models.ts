/**
 * Model selection and resolution for the pi harness.
 *
 * One model runs the entire workflow. Users name it with a single setting:
 *
 *   ASTRA_AI_MODEL=<provider>:<model-id>
 *
 * The provider half decides the endpoint, the credential, and the API dialect;
 * the model half is passed to pi's registry as-is. The separator is a colon
 * because model IDs routinely contain slashes, and it is the *first* colon that
 * splits, because Bedrock model IDs contain colons of their own
 * (`amazon-bedrock:us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`).
 *
 * Resolution returns a pi `Model` plus the `ModelRuntime` that owns its auth,
 * built over an in-memory credential store primed from the environment.
 *
 * The catalogue is refreshed over the network at scan start, so a newly released model
 * on a catalogue provider resolves on its own. A model the catalogue does not carry, such
 * as a router model under its own id, or a self-hosted server, is described in a
 * pi `models.json` (the CLI's `--models-config`), which merges over the catalogue. The
 * credential store below outranks any `apiKey` that file carries, so it describes the
 * model while the environment still supplies the secret.
 *
 * The CLI cannot import this module (it ships as a separate bundle), so
 * `apps/cli/src/model-spec.ts` mirrors the parse rule and the provider/credential
 * tables by hand for its own `status` rendering and setup wizard. The two copies
 * have no shared compile-time link: a provider added or renamed on one side and
 * not the other does not fail to build, it just makes the CLI's guidance or
 * guard rails disagree with what the worker actually accepts at runtime.
